Imagine you have the 4 crop variants "Desktop", "Landscape", "Tablet"
and "Mobile" at your disposal, then it may happen that you have to copy the
crop area of "Desktop" to all other crop variants. Slight shifts of the image
crop between the crop variants are almost inevitable. `sync_crop_areas`
provides a remedy here and offers you to transfer the image crop of the
first crop variant (here: "Desktop") to all other crop variants with the
same image ratio.

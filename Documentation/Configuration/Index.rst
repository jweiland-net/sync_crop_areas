What does it do?
----------------

With sync_crop_areas you can decide, if you want to copy the crop area of first crop variant over to all other crop
variants. E.g. you have defined 4 crop variants "Desktop", "Landscape", "Tablet" and "Mobile". If you move
the crop area of "Desktop", you have to do so with "Landscape", "Tablet" and "Mobile", too, which is a lot of work
for your editors. Further it is hard to match the exact position (cropArea) in all other cropVariants.
